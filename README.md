## About the Video Course
This video course will set you on the path to become a skilled and professional Java developer by exploring Java9 and Java EE 8 and learning how these technologies can be used to create a modern, scalable enterprise application.

We will use case studies to explore how we can use the JEE8 technologies of JSF, EJB, and JPA to build a database-driven website, while all the time working with new Java 9 constructs. You'll learn how to extract a component from our website as a standalone microservice and decouple your microservice to allow it to be reused within an organization. We will then delve into Java 9 technologies such as JShell, modules, the Streams API, Multi-Jar, Process APIs, and HTTP/2 clients.
